# Student Attendance Monitoring System

This project is a system used to monitor the attendance of students. The project employs image processing and artificial intelligence techniques to recognize students' faces and determine their attendance status.
##  Usage
When the program is started, the cameras are automatically activated. When students' faces are detected, the system automatically determines the attendance status using a face recognition algorithm.

## Tools
**Lang:** Python

**TensorFlow:** An open-source machine learning framework designed to provide a flexible and efficient platform for building and training neural networks.

**Keras:** A high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, designed for fast experimentation with deep neural networks.

**OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library):** A library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision, providing tools for image and video analysis.

**Pillow:** A Python Imaging Library (PIL) fork, which adds image processing capabilities to Python. It is used for opening, manipulating, and saving various image file formats.

**Matplotlib:** A comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It is often used for data visualization and image plotting.
